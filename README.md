# Gestion projet p√©dagogique project
My very first angular project in summer 2019 during an internship. I was tasked with creating a module of an app, both backend and frontend. This is the frontend part of the module.

During this project, I mainly used property binding and event binding for cross components communication. The services were used to communicate with the backend
